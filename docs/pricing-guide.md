# Pricing Guide

## Learn & Leverage AI — Service Pricing Framework

This guide helps us price AI and automation projects consistently, even when scope is still abstract. Use it alongside the Client Intake Questionnaire.

---

## Pricing Philosophy

**We price on value and outcomes, not hours.** A 2-hour automation that saves a client 10 hours/week is worth far more than the time we spent building it. Our pricing should reflect the result, not the effort.

Core principles:
- **Quote in tiers**, not hourly rates (clients hate open-ended billing)
- **Anchor to ROI** — frame every price against what it saves or earns them
- **Start small, expand later** — land a Quick Win, prove value, then upsell
- **Include ongoing revenue** — most projects need maintenance; build retainers in

---

## Tier 1: Quick Wins — $250–$750

**What it is:** Single, simple automations or AI tool setups that deliver immediate value with minimal complexity.

**Typical projects:**
- Set up ChatGPT or Claude with custom prompts for their business (estimate templates, email drafts, scripts)
- Configure automated review request sequences (after job completion)
- Set up automated appointment reminders (email/SMS)
- Create a simple Zapier/Make workflow (e.g., new lead → CRM → notification)
- Social media content calendar generation with AI
- Basic email template automation

**Scope:**
- 1–3 hours of our time
- No custom integrations
- Uses existing off-the-shelf tools
- Minimal training needed

**Delivery:** 1–3 business days

**Why this price:** These are entry-point projects. The goal is to prove our value and build trust. Many of these turn into Tier 2–3 projects once the client sees results.

**Monthly recurring (optional):** $50–$150/mo for ongoing optimization and support

---

## Tier 2: Standard Automations — $1,000–$3,500

**What it is:** Multi-step automations or AI implementations that solve a specific business problem end-to-end.

**Typical projects:**
- AI chatbot on their website (lead capture, FAQ answering, appointment booking)
- Automated lead follow-up sequence (multi-channel: email + SMS + voicemail drop)
- AI-assisted estimate/proposal generation from job details
- Automated customer communication workflows (job updates, completion follow-ups, review requests — full lifecycle)
- AI phone receptionist setup (using Bland.ai, Synthflow, Vapi, etc.)
- Reporting dashboard pulling from their existing tools
- CRM cleanup + automation setup

**Scope:**
- 5–15 hours of our time
- 1–3 tool integrations

| Data migration/cleanup | None | Moderate |
| Training needed | Quick walkthrough | Full team training |
| Tools already in place | Yes | Need to set up from scratch |

**Monthly recurring:** $150–$500/mo for hosting, monitoring, optimization, and support

---

| Ongoing dependencies | Few | Many moving parts |

**Monthly recurring:** $500–$2,000/mo for hosting, AI platform costs, monitoring, optimization, and priority support

---

## Tier 4: Enterprise/Retainer — $2,500–$7,500/month

**What it is:** Ongoing AI strategy and implementation partnership. We become their fractional AI department.

**Typical arrangement:**

## How to Price a Specific Project

### Step 1: Identify the Tier

Use the questionnaire answers to determine which tier fits:

| Signal | Likely Tier |
|---|---|
| "I just need help setting up ChatGPT for my business" | Tier 1 |
| "I want my phones answered after hours" | Tier 2 |
| "I want to automate my entire lead-to-review pipeline" | Tier 3 |
| "I want you guys handling all my AI stuff ongoing" | Tier 4 |

### Step 2: Assess Complexity Multipliers

These factors push pricing higher within a tier (or up to the next tier):

| Factor | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Data is messy** — contacts in spreadsheets, paper, phones | +25–50% |
| **No existing software** — need to set up CRM, tools from scratch | +25–50% |
| **Multiple locations** — each needs separate config | +50–100% per location |
| **Compliance needs** — HIPAA, PCI, or other regulations | +25–50% |
| **Rush timeline** — needs it in days, not weeks | +25–50% |
| **Custom AI training** — voice cloning, custom models, fine-tuning | +50–100% |
| **Integration complexity** — tools don't have native connections | +25–50% |

### Step 3: Estimate Monthly Tool Costs (Pass-Through)

These are costs the client pays directly to tool providers. Always be transparent about these:

| Tool Category | Typical Monthly Cost |
|---|---|
| AI phone/voice agent (Bland, Synthflow, Vapi) | $50–$500/mo depending on call volume |
| Chatbot platform (Intercom, Drift, custom) | $50–$300/mo |
| Automation platform (Zapier, Make) | $20–$100/mo |
| CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot) | $97–$300/mo |
| AI tools (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, etc.) | $20–$200/mo |
| SMS/email platform (Twilio, SendGrid) | $20–$200/mo based on volume |
| **Total typical client tool spend** | **$100–$500/mo for most home service businesses** |

### Step 4: Build the ROI Story

Before quoting, calculate the value so you can frame the price:

**Time savings formula:**
```
Hours saved per week × hourly value of that time × 52 weeks = annual savings
```

Example: AI phone answering saves the owner 8 hrs/week of phone time
- 8 hrs × $75/hr (owner's effective rate) × 52 = $31,200/year in recovered time
- Our fee: $2,500 setup + $300/mo = $6,100 first year
- **ROI: 5x return**

**Revenue recovery formula:**
```
Missed calls/leads per week × close rate × average job value × 52 = recovered revenue
```

Example: They miss 10 calls/week, close 30%, average job $500
- 10 × 0.30 × $500 × 52 = $78,000/year in recovered revenue
- Our fee: $2,500 setup + $300/mo = $6,100 first year
- **ROI: 12x return**

Always present pricing alongside the ROI calculation.

## Discounting Rules

| Scenario | Discount |
|---|---|
| **Event attendee** booking within 7 days of event | 10% off setup |
| **Multi-project bundle** (2+ projects at once) | 15% off total setup |
| **Annual retainer commitment** (vs. month-to-month) | 2 months free (pay 10, get 12) |
| **Referral from existing client** | 10% off for both parties |
| **Case study permission** (we can use their results in marketing) | 10–15% off |

**Never discount more than 25% total.** If they can't afford it, move them to a lower tier or scope, don't slash the price.

## Common Objections & Responses

**"That seems expensive for some automation."**
> "I understand — let me show you the math. This will save you [X hours/week], which at your rate is worth [$X/year]. You'll make back this investment in [X months], and after that it's pure savings. This isn't a cost — it's the last time you pay for this problem."

**"Can't I just use ChatGPT myself?"**
> "You absolutely can for some things, and we'll show you how in the training. What we're building goes beyond what you can do with ChatGPT alone — we're connecting it to your actual business systems so it works automatically, 24/7, without you touching it."

**"I need to think about it."**
> "Of course. Just so you know, we only take on [X] implementation projects per month so we can give each client proper attention. No pressure at all — I'll follow up [next week] to see where you're at."

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**
> "I could reduce the scope — for example, we could start with just [smaller piece] for [$lower amount] and add the rest later once you've seen the results. I'd rather you get a great result on something focused than a mediocre result trying to do everything at once."

**"My buddy's kid can do this."**
> "They might be able to get something started, but the difference is in reliability, integration with your actual business tools, and having someone who understands both the tech AND how a home service business actually runs. When your AI phone system goes down at 9pm on a Friday and you're missing emergency calls, you want someone you can call. That's what you're paying for."
