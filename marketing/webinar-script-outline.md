# Webinar Script Outline
## "AI for Contractors: Stop Losing Money to Missed Calls & Manual Work"
### 60 Minutes Total — Thursday Feb 27, 2:00 PM EST

---

## SEGMENT 1: Brandon's Story (0:00 – 5:00)

**Goal:** Build credibility and relatability. You're not a tech bro — you're a contractor.

**Talking Points:**
- "Hey everybody, I'm Brandon. I'm a contractor. I run a pool service company in Delaware."
- Quick story: Corporate job → hated it → quit → started a pool company
- Year one reality: doing EVERYTHING yourself — cleaning pools, answering phones, doing estimates at midnight, zero social media presence
- The turning point: "I started losing jobs not because I was bad at my trade, but because I couldn't answer the phone while I was working."
- "I started experimenting with AI tools — not the flashy stuff you see on Twitter, but practical tools that do the boring work for you."
- "Today I'm going to show you exactly what I use. Live. No slides. No fluff."

**Transition:** "Let me start with the problem, because I know you already feel it."

## SEGMENT 2: The Problem — "The 3 Calls You Missed This Week" (5:00 – 15:00)

**Goal:** Agitate the pain. Make it specific and financial.

**Talking Points:**
- "How many of you missed at least one call this week while you were on a job? Drop a number in chat."
- The math: Average contractor misses 2-3 calls/day. Average job value $200-$500. That's $400-$1,500/day. $2,000-$7,500/week. $8,000-$30,000/month.
- "Nobody leaves voicemails anymore. They hang up and call the next guy on Google."
- The second problem: Social media. "Customers check your Facebook or Instagram before they call. If your last post was 6 months ago, they move on."
- The third problem: Admin work. "You didn't start a business to do invoices on Sunday night."
- Real stats if available: % of consumers who won't leave a voicemail, % who check social before hiring
- "The problem isn't that you're bad at your job. The problem is there's only one of you."

**Transition:** "So what if there was a way to handle all that stuff without hiring anyone? Let me show you."

## SEGMENT 3: Live Demo #1 — AI Phone Receptionist (15:00 – 25:00)

**Goal:** Jaw-drop moment. Show, don't tell.

**Setup:**
- "I'm going to call a real business phone number right now. An AI receptionist will answer. Watch what happens."
- Share screen showing the Call2Calendar dashboard
- Explain briefly: "This is an AI phone system built specifically for contractors."

**Live Demo:**
1. Call the demo business line from your phone (speaker on)
2. AI answers in a natural voice with the business greeting
3. AI asks what service the caller needs
4. AI collects name, contact info, preferred date/time
5. AI confirms the appointment and ends the call professionally
6. Show the dashboard: new appointment appeared, customer info captured, text notification sent

**Debrief:**
- "That entire call took 90 seconds. No hold music. No voicemail. No missed job."
- "This works 24/7. Nights, weekends, holidays. While you're on a roof, under a sink, or at your kid's baseball game."
- "Let me ask you — how many jobs would you have saved last month if every call got answered like that?"

**Transition:** "Now let me show you the other thing that changed my business."

## SEGMENT 4: Live Demo #2 — AI Content Generation (25:00 – 35:00)

**Goal:** Second jaw-drop. Speed and quality.

**Setup:**
- "Quick poll in chat — what's your trade? Plumber? Electrician? Landscaper? HVAC?"
- Pick one from the chat (audience engagement)

**Live Demo:**
1. Open ContentCreationDude
2. Type in the trade from chat (e.g., "HVAC company in Phoenix, AZ")
3. Hit generate
4. Show 7 days of posts appearing in real time — each with caption, hashtags, and image suggestion
5. Time it: "That was 47 seconds for a full week of content."

**Debrief:**
- Scroll through the posts. Read a couple out loud. "These aren't generic robot posts. They're specific to your trade, your market, your services."
- "You can edit them, approve them, schedule them. Or just post them as-is."
- "How long would it take you to write 7 social media posts? Most people say 3-5 hours. This took under a minute."
- "And here's the thing — bad social media is better than no social media. But this isn't even bad. This is solid."

**Transition:** "Now let's talk about what this is actually worth to your business."

## SEGMENT 5: ROI Calculator Walkthrough (35:00 – 40:00)

**Goal:** Make it personal. Show them THEIR numbers.

**Talking Points:**
- Share screen: simple ROI calculator (spreadsheet or tool)
- "Let's plug in some numbers together."
- **Missed calls:** "If you miss just 2 calls a day, 5 days a week, at an average job value of $300..."
  - 2 × 5 × $300 = $3,000/week = $12,000/month in potential lost revenue
  - "Even if only 1 in 3 would've booked, that's $4,000/month."
- **Social media:** "Companies with active social media get 2-3x more inbound leads than those without."
- **Time saved:** "5 hours/week on content + 1 hour/day on phone management = ~10 hours/week back"
  - "What's your hourly rate? $50? $75? That's $500-$750/week in time value."
- "So we're talking about $4,000-$5,000/month in combined value from two tools."

**Transition:** "Alright, I want to tell you about something I put together for people who watched this and want to get started. Then we'll do Q&A."

## SEGMENT 6: The Offer — AI Starter Pack (40:00 – 45:00)

**Goal:** Clean, no-pressure pitch. 5 minutes max.

**Talking Points:**
- "If you want to set this up yourself, you totally can. Everything I showed you today exists as tools you can go try."
- "But if you want it done for you — set up, customized, ready to go — I put together something specifically for webinar attendees."

**The AI Starter Pack — $497:**
- ✅ AI Phone Receptionist — fully set up for your business (custom greeting, your services, your calendar). "This setup alone is $750 if you came to us outside the webinar."
- ✅ 1 Month of AI Content Generation — a full month of social posts, generated and ready to schedule
- ✅ 30-Minute Strategy Call with Brandon — we go through your specific business and find every place AI can save you time
- ✅ Bonus: "10 Things AI Can Do for Your Business This Week" action checklist — on the house

**Pricing context:**
- "The phone receptionist setup is normally $750. I'm doing the whole package — receptionist, content, strategy call, playbook — for $497 because I want case studies. I want to prove this works for every trade."

**Urgency:**
- "This price is available for 48 hours after this webinar. There's a link in the chat and I'll email it to everyone after."

**Objection handlers (weave in naturally):**
- "What if I'm not tech-savvy?" → "I set it up for you. You don't touch any tech."
- "What if it doesn't work for my trade?" → "I've set this up for plumbers, electricians, HVAC, landscapers, pool companies, painters, roofers. It works."
- "What if I want to cancel?" → "It's a one-time setup, not a subscription. You own it."

**Soft close:**
- "No pressure at all. If you just came to learn, I hope this was worth your time. Use the free checklist."
- "If you're ready to stop missing calls and start showing up on social media — the link's in the chat."

**Transition:** "Alright — let's do Q&A. What questions do you have?"

## SEGMENT 7: Live Q&A (45:00 – 60:00)

**Goal:** Build trust, handle objections, create connection.

**Prep: Common questions and answers:**

**Q: How much does the AI phone system cost monthly after setup?**
A: [Insert actual Call2Calendar pricing — be transparent]

**Q: Can it handle multiple calls at the same time?**
A: Yes, unlike a human receptionist. It can handle unlimited simultaneous calls.

**Q: What if a customer asks something the AI can't answer?**
A: It's trained on your services and FAQs. For anything outside that, it takes a message and alerts you immediately.

**Q: Does the social media content actually look good?**
A: You saw it live. And you approve everything before it goes out. Nothing posts without your OK.

**Q: I barely use social media. Will this actually help?**
A: Especially then. Going from zero posts to consistent weekly content is the biggest jump. Customers Google you. If they find active social media, they're more likely to call.

**Q: Can I see another demo of the phone AI?**
A: [If time allows, do another live call with a different scenario]

**Closing:**
- "Thank you all for spending an hour with me. Seriously."
- "Check your email — the replay, the free checklist, and the Starter Pack link are all coming."
- "If you have questions that didn't get answered, reply to any of my emails. I read every one."
- "Go answer some calls. Or better yet — let AI do it for you. ✌️"
