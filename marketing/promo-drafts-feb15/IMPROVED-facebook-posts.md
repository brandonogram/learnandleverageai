# Facebook Group Posts — IMPROVED

---

### Primary Post ( contractors / home services groups)

**Headline:** How many calls did you miss this week?

**Body:**

Real talk — I counted mine last month: 82 calls I couldn't answer because I was on a job.

That's not just 82 missed calls. That's 17 appointments I never got to book. That's thousands in revenue for my competitors.

I tried answering services (clueless). Tried calling everyone back (impossible). Tried ignoring it (expensive).

Finally built an AI that answers like a real person, books estimates, and texts me the details. She works 24/7 and never calls in sick.

If you're tired of lighting money on fire every time your phone buzzes, I'm doing a free live demo on Feb 27. No pitch deck, no slides — just me showing you my actual system and how to build it.

Comment "SHOW ME" and I'll DM you the link.

### Variation 1 ( more direct, for business groups )

**Headline:** I was losing $31,000/year to missed calls. Here's the math:

**Body:**

Average job: $185
Missed calls/week: 12
Close rate on callbacks: 30%

That's $650/week I was giving to competitors. $31,000/year.

Just. From. Not. Picking. Up.

Built an AI receptionist that handles it all now. Books appointments while I work. No more voicemail graveyard.

I'm showing other contractors how to do this Feb 27 in a free live demo — real system, real numbers, no corporate BS.

If that math made you sick to your stomach, you need to be there.

Link in comments (if that's cool with mods — otherwise comment DEMO and I'll send it).

### Variation 2 ( problem-solution, for trade-specific groups )

**Headline:** Your phone is your best salesperson. Stop making them leave a message.

**Body:**

Here's what happens when a customer calls:

❌ Voicemail → They call someone else → You lose the job
✅ Human answers → Books estimate → You show up and get paid

Problem is, YOU can't be the one answering when you're on a roof, under a sink, or running equipment.

I solved it with an AI that sounds human, asks the right questions, and books the job. It's caught 82 calls and booked 17 appointments I would've missed.

If your voicemail box is a graveyard for lost revenue, I'm doing a free live demo Feb 27 showing exactly how this works.

Comment CALLS and I'll send you the link.

### Variation 3 ( conversation starter for engagement )

**Headline:** What's the #1 thing bleeding money in your business?

**Body:**

Mine was missed calls. Drove me absolutely insane. 82 voicemails last month. 17 jobs I never got to bid on.

I fixed it with AI, but I'm curious — what's your silent killer? The thing that costs you money but isn't the actual work?

Is it:
• Following up on quotes?
• Scheduling chaos?
• Chasing payments?
• Something else?

Drop it in the comments. Highest pain point gets my detailed breakdown of how I solved mine (and it might work for yours too).

### Comment Templates (for replies)

**If someone asks about cost:**
"Less than a part-time receptionist. Mine pays for herself 6x over in recovered revenue. DM me if you want the demo link."

**If someone says they use an answering service:**
"Tried that. They were clueless about my services and couldn't book appointments. AI knows what I charge, what I need to know about jobs, and books directly on my calendar. Totally different."

**If someone is skeptical:**
"I get it. I was too. But I ran the numbers — $31K/year in lost revenue vs. $X/month for AI. Easy math. Watch the demo, see for yourself: [LINK]"
