**Title:** Your favorite contractor isn't ignoring you — they're on a roof

**Body:**

Quick perspective from the other side:

I run a couple service businesses (pools, Christmas lights). The #1 complaint I hear from homeowners is "I left three voicemails and nobody called back."

Here's the thing: the person doing your work is the same person answering the phone. If I'm 20 feet up on a ladder, I physically cannot take your call. And by the time I'm down, you've already hired the next guy on Google.

It's a lose-lose. You're frustrated. I lose revenue I desperately needed. All because I was busy doing good work.

I finally solved it by building an AI receptionist that answers every call, books appointments, and makes sure I see every inquiry. Last month it caught 82 calls and booked 17 jobs I would have missed.

I'm showing other contractors how to do this in a free live demo on Feb 27. No sales pitch — just me walking through my actual setup.

**Title:** I was losing $2,600/month to missed calls. Here's how I fixed it.

**Body:**

Run the numbers with me:

• Average job value: $185
• Missed calls per week: ~12
• Closing rate on callbacks: ~30%

That's $650/week in revenue going to competitors because I was busy working.

$2,600/month. $31,000/year.

Just from not picking up the damn phone.

Couldn't afford a full-time receptionist. Answering services were clueless. Family help wasn't sustainable.

So I built an AI that answers like a human, qualifies leads, and books paid estimates directly on my calendar. She handles 82 calls/month and never calls in sick.

Last month she booked $3,145 in jobs I would have missed. Paid for herself 6x over.

If you're bleeding money to voicemail, I'm doing a free live demo on Feb 27 showing exactly how it works — my actual system, real numbers, no fluff.

Happy to answer questions about my setup in the comments.

### Post for r/Contractor

**Title:** Every missed call is a job for your competitor. I stopped losing them.

**Body:**

How many calls did you miss this week?

Mine used to be dozens. Phone buzzing in my pocket while I'm on a roof, under a sink, running a saw. Every missed call = another job for the next guy in the Google search.

You're getting punished for doing good work instead of being a receptionist.

I got tired of lighting money on fire, so I built an AI front desk:

• Answers 24/7
• Sounds like a real person (not "please listen carefully as our menu options have changed")
• Books estimates on my calendar
• Texts me the details

Costs less than a part-time helper. Never calls in sick. Doesn't lose sticky notes.

Last month: 82 calls handled, 17 appointments booked while I was working.

I'm doing a free live demo on Feb 27 showing exactly how it works — my actual system, not theory. If you're sick of watching revenue walk away every time your phone buzzes, you need to see this.
