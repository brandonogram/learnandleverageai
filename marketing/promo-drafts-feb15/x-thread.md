You know the worst feeling as a contractor? Finishing a job, checking your phone, and seeing 3 missed calls.

That's not just 3 missed calls. It's potentially thousands in revenue, gone. Because you were on a ladder instead of at a desk.

This was my life running my pool company.

I left a cushy corporate job to be my own boss, not to be a receptionist.

But I was spending half my day calling people back who'd already hired someone else. Or worse, just sending every call to voicemail and praying.

It's a broken system. You can't be in two places at once.

So I did what any unhinged, ADHD, ex-corporate guy would do.

I taught an AI to answer the phone for me.

Not a robot voice. Not a shitty call center. An AI that sounds human, understands the customer's needs, and books the job right on my calendar.

Last month, my AI receptionist ("she") handled 82 calls for my businesses while I was working.

She booked 17 appointments. That's 17 jobs I would have missed.

This isn't theory. It's what I'm using right now to stop losing money.

I'm tired of seeing tradespeople get screwed by expensive, clunky software or miss out on revenue they've earned.

So I'm doing a free, no-bullshit webinar to show you exactly how this works.

Live demos. Real numbers. You can ask me anything.
