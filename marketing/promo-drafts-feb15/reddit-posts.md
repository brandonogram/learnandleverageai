### Post for r/HomeImprovement

**Title:** Why your go-to contractor might not be answering the phone (and what I'm doing about it)

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Quick backstory: I'm a tech guy who left the corporate world and now runs a couple of service businesses (pools, Christmas lights). I spend a lot of time talking to other contractors, and I wanted to share something you've probably all experienced from the homeowner side.

You know when you find a great contractor, but they're impossible to get on the phone? It's not because they're ignoring you. It's usually because they're a small operation, and the person who does the work is the same person who answers the phone. They can't take your call if they're on a roof, under a sink, or running a saw.

The result is you get frustrated and hire someone else, and they lose out on a job they were perfect for. It's a lose-lose.

I got so fed up with this happening in my own business that I built an AI receptionist to handle my calls. It schedules estimates, answers basic questions, and makes sure a real human (me) sees every single inquiry. It's helped me stop missing jobs and allows me to focus on the actual work.

I think this kind of tech could help a lot of the good, honest contractors out there be more responsive. So, I'm hosting a free webinar on Feb 27th to show other tradespeople how they can set up something similar.

Not trying to sell anything here, just wanted to share a perspective from the other side. If you know a contractor who struggles with this, feel free to pass it along.

Cheers.

### Post for r/smallbusiness

**Title:** I was losing thousands in revenue to missed calls. I fixed it with an AI receptionist.

**Body:**

Hey r/smallbusiness,

I run a couple of local service businesses, and for the longest time, my biggest bottleneck wasn't marketing or operations—it was the damn phone.

Every time I was on a job, my phone would ring. I'd have to choose between doing the work I was already being paid for, or potentially landing a new customer. Most of the time, the call went to voicemail, and by the time I called back, they'd hired someone else.

I did the math and estimated I was losing 20-30% of my new leads purely because I couldn't pick up the phone. For a small business, that's survival.

I couldn't afford a full-time receptionist, so I built my own solution using AI. I now have an AI that answers every call, qualifies the lead, and books a paid estimate directly on my calendar. It sounds exactly like a human. My customers have no idea.

Last month, it handled 82 calls and booked 17 appointments I otherwise would have missed. That's thousands of dollars in revenue I captured without lifting a finger.

This has been such a massive unlock for me that I feel like I have to share it. I'm hosting a free webinar on Feb 27th at 2 PM EST to show other small business owners how to do the same thing. No fluff, just a live demo of my system and the exact steps to build it.

If you're tired of voicemails that never call back, this is for you.

Happy to answer any questions about my setup in the comments.

### Post for r/Contractor

**Title:** Sick of losing jobs because you're on a ladder instead of the phone? I am too.

**Body:**

Alright guys, real talk.

How many calls did you miss this week?

For me, it used to be dozens. I'd be on a job, phone buzzing in my pocket, knowing every missed call was another job I just lost to the next guy in the Google search. It's the most frustrating part of the job. You're trying to do good work, but you're getting punished for not being a receptionist.

I finally got pissed off enough to solve it. I built an AI that acts as my front desk.

*   She answers 24/7.
*   She sounds like a real person (no robot voice).
*   She asks the right questions (I trained her on what to say).
*   She books the estimate on my calendar and sends me a text with the details.

It costs me less than a part-time helper and she's never called in sick. More importantly, I don't lose leads anymore.

I'm doing a free webinar for other contractors on Feb 27th to show exactly how it works. No sales pitch, just a live demo of my system. If you want to see how to stop leaving money on the table, you should be there.
