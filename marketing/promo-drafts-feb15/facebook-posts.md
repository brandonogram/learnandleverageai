**Headline:** Question for you guys: How are you handling new customer calls while you're out on a job?

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Been running my own service businesses for a bit and this is the one thing that always gets me. I'm out on a job, trying to focus, and my phone is blowing up with new leads. I can't answer, they go to voicemail, and I'm lucky if 1 in 10 calls back.

It's a ton of lost money.

I got fed up and built a solution using AI that basically acts as my receptionist. She answers, asks the right questions, and books estimates for me.

It's been a total game-changer, and I'm curious if other people are dealing with this same headache. What's working for you? Are you using a call service, hiring someone, or just hoping they leave a voicemail?

### Variation 1 (More Direct)

**Headline:** Is anyone else sick of losing jobs just because you can't answer your phone?

**Body:**

I did the math and figured I was losing thousands a month just from missed calls while I was on site. Hired an answering service, but they were clueless. Had a family member help, but that wasn't sustainable.

Finally built my own AI receptionist that handles it all.

I'm putting on a free webinar on Feb 27th to show a few other contractors how I did it. No sales pitch, just a live demo of how it works. If you're tired of your voicemail box being a graveyard for lost revenue, you should check it out.

Link is in the comments if that's cool with the mods.

### Variation 2 (Conversation Starter)

**Headline:** What's the single biggest operational headache in your business right now?

**Body:**

For me, it was missing customer calls. Drove me absolutely insane. Felt like I was lighting money on fire every single day.

I ended up solving it with some cool AI tech, but it got me thinking: what are the other "silent killers" in a contracting business? What are the things that drive you crazy that aren't the actual work itself?

Curious to hear what everyone's dealing with.
