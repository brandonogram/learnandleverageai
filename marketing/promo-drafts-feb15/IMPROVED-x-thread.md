Three missed calls on my phone.

I was on a roof hanging Christmas lights. Couldn't answer.

Checked my voicemail later — two had already hired someone else. The third didn't leave a message.

That's $600 in revenue lost because I was busy working.

This used to happen every damn day.

I didn't leave corporate to be a receptionist.

But I was spending half my day calling people back who'd already moved on. Or just sending every call to voicemail and hoping.

The worst part? I was GOOD at the work. Just terrible at being two places at once.

So I taught an AI to answer the phone.

Not a robot voice. A real conversation. She asks what they need, checks my calendar, books the job, and texts me the details.

She doesn't call in sick. Doesn't get overwhelmed. Doesn't forget to call people back.

It's my best employee and she costs less than a part-time helper.

Last month she handled 82 calls across my businesses.

Booked 17 appointments. 

That's 17 jobs I would have missed while I was on a ladder, under a pool, or in the truck between sites.

Not theory. This is what I'm using right now.

Most tradespeople are losing thousands and don't even know it.

So I'm doing a free live demo. No slides. No corporate pitch deck.

Just me showing you the actual system, how it works, and how to set it up.
