## EMAIL 2 — Day Before (Feb 26, 10:00 AM EST)

**Subject:** Tomorrow at 2pm — here's what I'm demoing live

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick reminder — tomorrow's the day.

**Thursday, Feb 27 at 2:00 PM EST** — I'm going live on Zoom to show you exactly how contractors are using AI to stop leaving money on the table.

Here's what I've got planned:

🔴 **Live Demo #1:** I'm calling a real contractor's business line. An AI receptionist will answer, talk to the "customer," collect their info, and book the job. You'll watch the whole thing happen in real time.

🔴 **Live Demo #2:** I'll pick a trade (maybe yours if you shout it out in chat) and generate a full week of social media posts — captions, hashtags, everything — in 60 seconds flat.

📊 **ROI Calculator:** I'll walk through the math on missed calls. Most contractors don't realize they're losing $2,000-$5,000/month from calls that go to voicemail. We'll plug in real numbers.

**This is not a PowerPoint presentation.** It's live demos and real talk. Bring your questions — the last 15 minutes are all Q&A.

Your Zoom link will arrive tomorrow morning. Keep an eye out.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

We start at **2:00 PM EST today.** That's 2 hours from now.

👉 **Join the webinar:** [ZOOM LINK]

A few things:
- Show up a couple minutes early if you can
- Have questions ready — the last 15 min are live Q&A
- I'll be demoing real AI tools live, so it's worth watching (not just listening)

**Can't make it?** No worries. I'll send you the replay tomorrow. But the live version is better — you can ask questions and interact.

See you at 2.
