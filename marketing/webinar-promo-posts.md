### Tweet 1 (Awareness)
I missed a $3,000 job last year because I was on a roof and couldn't answer my phone.

Now AI answers every call for my business. Books the job. Sends me a text.

I'm showing how it works — live, for free — on Feb 27.

### Tweet 2 (Social Proof / Curiosity)
Most contractors spend 5+ hours a week on stuff that isn't actual work.

Invoices. Follow-ups. Social media. Answering calls.

What if AI handled all of it?

I'm doing a free live demo on Feb 27 at 2pm EST. No fluff. Just showing you what's possible.

### Tweet 3 (Urgency — closer to event)
This Thursday at 2pm EST:

I'm going to call a real contractor's phone number live on Zoom.

An AI receptionist will answer, talk to the "customer," and book the job.

Then I'll generate a full week of social media posts in 60 seconds.

Free to watch: [LINK]

### Thread (Story-driven)

**1/** I left corporate America to start a pool company.

Best decision I ever made. But I almost went broke in year one.

Not because I couldn't do the work. Because I couldn't do EVERYTHING.

Here's what I mean 🧵

**2/** When you're a one-man crew, you're the technician, the salesperson, the bookkeeper, the social media manager, and the receptionist.

I was losing 2-3 calls a day while I was on jobs. Each one worth $200-$500.

That's $2,000-$6,000/month. Gone.

**3/** I started messing around with AI — not the ChatGPT-write-me-a-poem stuff.

Real, practical tools:
- AI that answers my phone and books appointments
- AI that generates a week of social posts in 60 seconds
- AI that handles follow-ups so I don't forget

**4/** My pool company grew 40% in 6 months. Not because I worked harder. Because I stopped dropping the ball on the business side.

Other contractors started asking what I was doing.

So I built it into tools anyone can use.

**5/** On Feb 27 at 2pm EST, I'm doing a free live webinar where I demo everything.

- Live phone call answered by AI
- Social media content generated in real time
- ROI calculator so you can see your own numbers

No pitch deck. No jargon. Just a contractor showing other contractors what works.

### r/smallbusiness Post

**Title:** I'm a contractor who uses AI to answer my phone and generate social media content. Doing a free live demo if anyone's curious.

**Body:**
Hey all — I run a service business (pool company in Delaware). Last year I started using AI tools to handle the stuff I didn't have time for:

- An AI receptionist that answers calls when I'm on a job, has a real conversation with the caller, and books appointments on my calendar
- AI content generation that creates a full week of social media posts in about 60 seconds

It's made a massive difference. I was losing 2-3 potential jobs per day from missed calls alone.

I'm doing a free live webinar on **Thursday Feb 27 at 2pm EST** where I demo both tools live — you can watch the AI answer a real phone call and generate real content in real time.

No course to sell. No "buy my mastermind." I do offer services for people who want help setting this up, but the webinar itself is just me showing you what's possible and answering questions for 15 minutes at the end.

If you're a contractor, tradesperson, or any service-based small business owner, this is built for you.

Happy to answer questions here too.

### r/Contractor Post

**Title:** Fellow contractors — I built an AI that answers my business phone when I'm on a job. Free live demo Feb 27.

**Body:**
I know how this sounds. Bear with me.

I run a pool service company. Like most of you, I spend my days actually working — which means I can't answer every call that comes in. Voicemail? Nobody leaves those anymore. They just call the next guy.

I set up an AI receptionist that:
- Answers in a natural voice
- Asks what service they need
- Collects their name, address, and preferred time
- Books it on my calendar
- Texts me a summary

I went from missing 2-3 calls a day to missing zero. That's easily an extra $3-5K/month in jobs I would've lost.

I also built an AI tool that generates a full week of social media posts (with captions and hashtags) in about a minute. Because let's be real — none of us want to be content creators, but customers DO check your social media before they hire you.

**I'm doing a free live demo of both tools on Thursday Feb 27 at 2pm EST on Zoom.** I'll actually call a business line live and let you watch the AI handle it. Then I'll generate content in real time.

No BS. No "guru" energy. I'm a contractor who figured some stuff out and wants to share it.

## FACEBOOK GROUP TEMPLATE

**Post (adapt for any contractor/trade/small business group):**

Hey [group name] 👋

Quick question — how many calls did you miss this week while you were on a job?

I used to miss 2-3 a day. Each one potentially worth $200-$500. Do the math on that over a month and it'll make you sick.

I'm a pool service contractor in Delaware, and last year I started using AI to handle the stuff I don't have time for — specifically answering my phone and creating social media content.

The phone AI answers calls in a natural voice, talks to the customer, collects their info, and books them on my calendar. I get a text summary. No missed calls, no voicemail, no lost jobs.

The content AI generates a full week of social posts in about 60 seconds. Captions, hashtags, everything. Because we all know we SHOULD be posting but who has time?

**I'm doing a FREE live demo on Thursday, February 27 at 2:00 PM EST.** On Zoom. I'll demo both tools live — you'll actually watch an AI answer a phone call in real time.

45 minutes of content + 15 min Q&A. No cost, no catch. I'll mention some services I offer at the end but 95% of this is just showing you what's possible.

If you're curious about AI but don't want the Silicon Valley sales pitch — this is for you.
