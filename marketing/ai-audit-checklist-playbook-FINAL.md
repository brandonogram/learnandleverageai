## #1 — Stop Missing After-Hours Calls (5 minutes to start)

**The Problem:** 60% of customer calls go to voicemail after 5 PM. Most never call back.

**The Action:** Set up call forwarding with voicemail transcription. For a more robust solution, set up an AI phone receptionist.

**The Tool:**
- **Free option:** Google Voice — forwards calls and transcribes voicemails to text
- **Pro option:** Call2Calendar AI receptionist — answers calls, has natural conversations, books appointments

**Your Prompt (for setting up Google Voice):**
1. Download Google Voice app
2. Link your business number
3. Enable "Do Not Disturb" with voicemail transcription after hours

**Expected Result:** Capture 5-10 calls per week you're currently missing. At $300 average job value, that's $1,500-$3,000 in recovered revenue.

## #2 — Write a Week of Social Media Posts in 60 Seconds

**The Problem:** You know you should post, but who has time to write captions?

**The Action:** Use AI to generate a full week of content instantly.

**Your Prompt:**
```
Write 5 Facebook posts for a [YOUR TRADE] business in [YOUR CITY]. 
Include: 
- 2 educational tips

- 1 seasonal/promotional post
Make each post sound natural and conversational, not salesy.
```

**The Tool:** ChatGPT (free) or ContentCreationDude Pro

## #3 — Create Professional Estimate Templates

**The Problem:** Handwritten or inconsistent estimates look unprofessional and cost you jobs.

## #4 — Auto-Send Review Requests After Every Job

**The Problem:** Happy customers forget to leave reviews. You forget to ask.

**The Action:** Set up an automated text/email that sends 2 hours after job completion.

**Your Prompt:**
```
Write a friendly text message asking a customer to leave a Google review. 
Keep it under 160 characters, conversational, and not pushy.
```

**Example Output:**
> "Hey [Name]! Thanks for choosing [Company]. If you were happy with our work, a quick review on Google would mean the world to us. Just search '[Company Name]' and tap 'Write a review.' Thanks again! — [Your Name]"

**The Tool:** Jobber, Housecall Pro, or simple scheduled text

**Expected Result:** 3-5x more Google reviews per month. More reviews = more calls = more revenue.

## #5 — Summarize Your Emails in 30 Seconds

**The Problem:** 50+ emails a day, most are noise.

**The Action:** Use AI to summarize your inbox and flag what actually needs attention.

**Your Prompt:**
```
Summarize these emails. Flag anything that needs a response today. 
Ignore newsletters, promotions, and automated notifications.
```

**Expected Result:** Save 30 minutes per day on email management. That's 2.5 hours per week back in your life.

## #6 — Generate a 90-Day Marketing Calendar

**The Problem:** Marketing is random — a post here, a flyer there, no plan.

**The Action:** Give AI your services and seasonality → get a complete 90-day calendar.

**Your Prompt:**
```
Create a 90-day social media and marketing calendar for a [YOUR TRADE] 
business in [YOUR REGION].

Format as a simple weekly list I can follow.
```

**The Tool:** ChatGPT/Claude + Google Sheets

## #7 — Train AI to Answer Your FAQs

**The Problem:** You answer the same 10 questions every day (pricing, service area, scheduling).

**The Action:** Write out your top 10 FAQs → paste into AI → create a custom chatbot or response guide.

**Your Prompt:**
```
Here are the 10 questions I get asked most often:
[LIST YOUR QUESTIONS]

Write clear, friendly answers to each. Keep them under 3 sentences where possible.
```

**Advanced:** Use ChatGPT custom GPTs or add a simple chatbot to your website.

**Expected Result:** Customers get instant answers. You stop repeating yourself. Save 30-60 minutes per day.

## #8 — Auto-Transcribe Voicemails and Job Notes

**The Problem:** Voicemails pile up. Job notes are scattered on scraps of paper.

**The Action:** Use AI transcription for all voice communications.

**The Tool:**
- Google Voice (free voicemail transcription)
- iPhone built-in transcription (tap voicemail, tap transcript)
- Otter.ai ($8/mo for advanced features)
- Voice-to-text for job notes (built into most phones)

**How to do it:**
1. Enable transcription on your voicemail
2. Use voice-to-text for all job notes in the field
3. Search your notes by keyword later

**Expected Result:** Searchable, organized notes without typing. Find any conversation in seconds.

## #9 — Create a Follow-Up Sequence for Leads

**The Problem:** You quote a job, then never follow up. The customer goes with someone who did.

**The Action:** Set up a simple 3-email follow-up sequence.

**Your Prompt:**
```
Write a 3-email follow-up sequence for a [YOUR TRADE] business after 
sending an estimate.

Day 1: Thank them and confirm they received the estimate
Day 3: Check in, offer to answer questions
Day 7: Final check-in with urgency ("booking up for the season")

Keep each email short, friendly, and not pushy.
```

**The Tool:** Mailchimp (free tier), GoHighLevel, Jobber, or even Gmail scheduled send

**Expected Result:** 10-20% more closed jobs from existing leads. Most contractors never follow up — you'll stand out.

**About Brandon Calloway**

I'm a contractor. I run a pool service company in Delaware. I started using AI to handle the business stuff I didn't have time for — answering phones, creating content, organizing my schedule.

My business grew. Other contractors started asking what I was doing differently. So I built tools specifically for trades and blue-collar businesses.

No complicated software. No enterprise pricing. Just AI that does the busy work so you can do YOUR work.

**Questions?** Reply to any email from me — I read every one.
