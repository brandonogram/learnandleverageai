## THE PROBLEM SECTION (Brief & Relatable)

### You Didn't Start a Business to Do Paperwork

Every hour you spend chasing payments, writing estimates, and managing schedules is an hour you're not:
- Closing the next deal
- On the site doing what you do best
- Home for dinner with your family

**The administrative work isn't making you money. It's just keeping you from losing it.**

You've thought about hiring help. But good people are expensive, hard to find, and tough to keep.

There's a better way. And it's finally accessible to contractors like us.

---

## THE SOLUTION SECTION

### AI Has Changed the Game

In the past 12 months, AI tools have matured from "tech-bro hype" to practical automation that actually works.

**Contractors using AI are now:**
- ✓ **Automating payment follow-ups** that used to eat their evenings
- ✓ **Generating estimates in minutes** instead of days
- ✓ **Qualifying leads while they sleep**
- ✓ **Scaling their business without scaling their team**

No coding. No IT department. No $10,000 software suites.

Just smart automation handling the work that doesn't require your expertise—so you can focus on what does.
