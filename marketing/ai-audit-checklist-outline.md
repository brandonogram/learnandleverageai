### The 10 Things

**#1 — Stop Missing After-Hours Calls (5 minutes to start)**
- Problem: 60% of customer calls go to voicemail after 5 PM. Most never call back.
- Action: Set up Google Voice forwarding + voicemail transcription, OR set up an AI phone receptionist (Call2Calendar demo link)
- Tool: Google Voice (free) or Call2Calendar ($50–$150/mo)
- Expected result: Capture 5–10 calls/week you're currently missing

**#2 — Write a Week of Social Media Posts in 60 Seconds**
- Problem: You know you should post, but who has time?
- Action: Open ChatGPT or ContentCreationDude → paste this prompt: "Write 5 Facebook posts for a [your trade] business in [your city]. Include tips, before/afters, and a call to action."
- Tool: ChatGPT (free) or ContentCreationDude Pro ($49/mo)
- Expected result: 5 ready-to-post social updates, done in under 2 minutes

**#3 — Create Professional Estimate Templates with AI**
- Problem: Handwritten or inconsistent estimates look unprofessional and cost you jobs
- Action: Prompt AI with your services + pricing → generate a clean, branded estimate template
- Prompt included: "Create a professional estimate template for a [trade] company. Include: company name, customer info, line items with descriptions, subtotal, tax, total, terms, and signature line."
- Tool: ChatGPT/Claude (free) + Google Docs or Canva
- Expected result: Professional estimates in 2 minutes instead of 20

**#4 — Auto-Send Review Requests After Every Job**
- Problem: Happy customers forget to leave reviews. You forget to ask.
- Action: Set up an automated text/email that fires 2 hours after job completion
- Tool: Jobber, Housecall Pro, or a simple Zapier workflow
- Prompt: "Write a friendly text message asking a customer to leave a Google review. Keep it under 160 characters."
- Expected result: 3–5x more Google reviews per month

**#5 — Summarize Your Emails in 30 Seconds**
- Problem: 50+ emails a day, most are noise
- Action: Forward your inbox to ChatGPT or use the Gmail AI summary feature
- Prompt: "Summarize these emails. Flag anything that needs a response today. Ignore newsletters and promotions."
- Tool: ChatGPT, Claude, or built-in Gmail/Outlook AI
- Expected result: 30 minutes/day saved on email

**#6 — Generate a 90-Day Marketing Calendar**
- Problem: Marketing is random — a post here, a flyer there, no plan
- Action: Give AI your services, seasonal trends, and target audience → get a full 90-day calendar
- Prompt included: "Create a 90-day social media and marketing calendar for a [trade] business in [region]. Include seasonal promotions, content themes, and posting schedule."
- Tool: ChatGPT/Claude + Google Sheets
- Expected result: A complete marketing plan in 10 minutes

**#7 — Train AI to Answer Your FAQs**
- Problem: You answer the same 10 questions every day (pricing, service area, scheduling)
- Action: Write out your top 10 FAQs → paste into ChatGPT → create a custom GPT or chatbot
- Tool: ChatGPT custom GPTs (free with Plus) or website chatbot
- Expected result: Customers get instant answers; you stop repeating yourself

**#8 — Auto-Transcribe Voicemails and Job Notes**
- Problem: Voicemails pile up, job notes are scattered
- Action: Use AI transcription for voicemails + voice-to-text for job notes in the field
- Tool: Otter.ai ($8/mo), Google Voice (free), or iPhone built-in transcription
- Expected result: Searchable, organized notes without typing

**#9 — Create a Simple Follow-Up Sequence for Leads**
- Problem: You quote a job, then never follow up. The customer goes with someone who did.
- Action: Set up a 3-email follow-up sequence: Day 1 (thank you + estimate), Day 3 (check-in), Day 7 (last chance)
- Prompt: "Write a 3-email follow-up sequence for a [trade] business after sending an estimate."
- Tool: Mailchimp (free tier), GoHighLevel, or Jobber
- Expected result: 10–20% more closed jobs from existing leads

**#10 — Use AI to Scope Out Your Competition**
- Problem: You don't know what competitors are charging or how they're marketing
- Action: Ask AI to analyze competitor websites, reviews, and pricing
- Prompt: "Analyze the top 5 [trade] companies in [city] based on their Google reviews. Summarize their strengths, weaknesses, average rating, and common complaints."
- Tool: ChatGPT + Google search
- Expected result: Competitive intelligence in 10 minutes that would take hours manually
