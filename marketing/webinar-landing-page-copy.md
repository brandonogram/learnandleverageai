## PAIN SECTION

### Sound familiar?

- 📱 You missed 3 calls this week while you were on a job. At least one was a $2,000 project.
- 📝 You spent Sunday night doing estimates, invoices, and "catching up" instead of being with your family.
- 📸 You know you should post on social media but who has time to write captions when there's real work to do?
- 💰 You're leaving money on the table every single day — not because you're bad at your job, but because there's only one of you.

**You didn't start your business to be a secretary, a social media manager, AND a contractor.**

## WHAT YOU'LL SEE (LIVE)

### In 45 minutes, I'm going to show you two things that changed my business:

**🔴 Live Demo #1 — AI Answering a Contractor's Phone**
I'm going to call a real contractor's business line, live on the webinar. An AI receptionist will answer, have a natural conversation with the caller, collect their info, and book them on the calendar. No hold music. No voicemail. No missed revenue.

**🔴 Live Demo #2 — A Week of Social Media Posts in 60 Seconds**
I'll type in a trade (plumbing, HVAC, landscaping — you pick) and AI will generate 7 days of ready-to-post content with captions, hashtags, and images. Sixty seconds. Done.

**Plus:**
- 📊 ROI Calculator — see exactly how much money missed calls are costing YOUR business
- ❓ 15-minute live Q&A — ask me anything about using AI in your trade
- 🎁 Free AI Audit Checklist — every registrant gets our "10-Point AI Readiness Audit for Contractors" PDF

## WHO IS THIS GUY?

### Meet Brandon Calloway

I spent years in corporate America. Hated it. Quit to start a pool service company in Delaware.

Built that business with my own two hands — literally. Cleaned pools. Fixed pumps. Answered every call myself.

Then I started using AI tools to handle the stuff I didn't have time for: answering phones when I was on a job, generating social media content, organizing my schedule.

My pool company grew. Other contractors started asking what I was doing differently.

So I built tools specifically for trades and blue-collar businesses. No complicated software. No enterprise pricing. Just AI that does the busy work so you can do YOUR work.

Now I want to show you how it works. For free. In 45 minutes.

## WHO THIS IS FOR

✅ Contractors, tradespeople, and blue-collar business owners
✅ Solo operators and small crews (1-20 employees)
✅ Anyone who's ever lost a job because they couldn't answer the phone
✅ Business owners who know they should be on social media but don't have time
✅ People who are curious about AI but don't want the Silicon Valley sales pitch

### Who this is NOT for:
❌ Enterprise companies with full IT departments
❌ People looking for a get-rich-quick scheme
❌ Anyone who thinks AI is going to replace hard work (it won't — it handles the busywork so you can do MORE hard work)
